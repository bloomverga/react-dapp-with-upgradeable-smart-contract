# React Dapp interacting with Upgradeable Solidity Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic upgradeable cmart contract use case.
It's the code for the tutorial [Create an upgradeable Solidity smart contract for a react dapp](https://medium.com/@BloomVerga/how-to-write-an-upgradeable-solidity-smart-contract-for-a-react-dapp-ebb570f86cce).

It comes with a sample upgradeable contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
